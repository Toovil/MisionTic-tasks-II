How does it work?

download the zip and unzip it

use your IDE of preference and import the java folder

execute the program and take into account that this program works with commands:

when the product you want to list is a song copy-paste this: 1&Canción&nameSong&Autor&price&gender&duration

("Canción" must not be changed )

when the product you want to list is an album copy-paste this: 1&Album&AlbumName&Autor&price&gender&numberSongs

The number 1 it's the command that list the product, to see the output use number 2

I'll be improving this program soon, thank you so much for use it.
